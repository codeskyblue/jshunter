    This is a new version. So I think the version should be 2.0.
    
    I rewrite almost all the whole code, except the "generate html".
    In this version, you donot need to worry about the program will be hang there.
    Because I import a kthread lib. This is such a good thing, you can set a timeout to a thread.
    And I learn regex recently, and found it so powerful, so you can see a lot of regex in my code.
    In some config file, I also use regex, so if you want to use this tool, You should know a
    little knowledge about regex.

    Ok, I need to go. time now is 11:11.   my motto(love parkour, love life)

    If you have some good idea or got some problem, please contact to me, thanks.

Developer complain:
    Hell know why python donot support try--except--finally.
    And the python library ConfigParser convert all the key to the lower case. (eg: adWeb -> adweb),
    who let you do this, I want the upper case char.
